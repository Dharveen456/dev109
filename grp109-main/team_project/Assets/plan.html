            2/7/2025 (Group Seven Day):
                Thee Senate held a formal meeting to discuss what should we do for a project.
                    1. Berry is the Repo Admin, Secretary#1, part one of two Frontend Developers.
                    2. Yesica is the other part of the Frontend Developers, Code Reviewers, Secretary#2.
                    3. Dharveen is the Backend Developers, code Reviewers, and Secretary#3
                We then planned on create a minimalist for the To-Do-List approach.
                Then Thee Senate discuss to go dark to work on code like the movie the Hackers.
                We kept Communication to only Problem-Solving help, questions, crashes. 
                (So, basically an on-call system)
